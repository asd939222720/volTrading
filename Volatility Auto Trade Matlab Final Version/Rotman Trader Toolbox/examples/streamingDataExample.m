%% Streaming Data from Rotman Interactive Trader to MATLAB(R)
% This example shows how to connect to and stream data from Rotman
% Interactive Trader (RIT) using |rotmanTrader| functionality.  RIT must be
% installed on your computer along with the Excel RTD Links.  For more
% information visit http://rit.rotman.utoronto.ca/software.asp.  This
% example also assumes that RIT is running Liability Trading 3 Case.

%% Create a Connection
% First step is to create a connection to RIT.  To do this, issue the
% |rotmanTrader| command.
rit = rotmanTrader

%%
% Notice that the rit connection has properties listed.  These default
% properties are always available and update with the frequency listed in
% the updateFreq property.  The default value is 2 seconds.  Also listed is
% the last update timestamp in lastUpdate.  To change the update frequency,
% set the property to a different value.  For example, to change it to 1
% seconds:
rit.updateFreq = 1

%% Subscribing to RIT Data
% Data is retrieved from RIT using the same server that is used for
% Microsoft Excel.  In RIT, you can click on the RTD link in the bottom
% right corner.  It will bring up this image with available data fields.
% 
% <<rtd_fields.png>>
%
% In Excel, you use the RTD function to return data.  In MATLAB, you use
% the |subscribe| command to enter the field information for the data you
% wish to subscribe to.  This will add the data to the rit variable we
% created earlier.  For example, to get the last traded price we need to
% enter two fields, the ticker symbol and the LAST string separated by a |.
% For example, to subscribe to security CRZY and add the LAST price to our
% connection to RIT (the rit variable defined earlier), type
subscribe(rit,'CRZY|LAST')
rit
%%
% You can see that RIT now has a new property of crzy_last that will update
% with last traded prices.  Subscriptions added will show up as additional
% properties.  To return the data, simply type
rit.crzy_last
%%
% Note that when |subscribe| is called, data is updated from RIT.  You can
% also force an update by issuing |update|
update(rit)
rit

%%
% We could also add the bid and ask as well.  Note the need to separate the
% list of two subscriptions by ";" is required.
subscribe(rit,{'CRZY|BID';'CRZY|ASK'})
rit
%%
% We could also obtain the latest news using LATESTNEWS|N where Nth is the
% order of latest news (most recent first)
subscribe(rit,'LATESTNEWS|1')
rit

%% Working with Streaming Data
% To work with streaming data, you add a function that is called each time
% data is updated.  To do this, let's first create a function that will
% display the last price for CRZY.
fcn = @(input) disp(['CRZY Last Traded at $',num2str(input.crzy_last,'%4.2f')])
newsFcn = @(input) extractNews(input.latestnews_1)

%%
% What we created here was a function that will print to the command window
% the last traded price for CRZY every time an update is called for
% |rotmanTrader| (every second in this case).  The input in this case is
% the |rotmanTrader| variable. For example, test the function:
fcn(rit)
newsFcn(rit)

%%
% Now add it to the list of updateFcns and it will be executed every time
% there is an update.
addUpdateFcn(rit,fcn)
addUpdateFcn(rit,newsFcn)
rit
pause(10)

%%
% Add another function for bids and asks
askfcn = @(input) disp(['CRZY ASK Price is $',num2str(input.crzy_ask,'%4.2f')])
addUpdateFcn(rit,askfcn)
bidfcn = @(input) disp(['CRZY BID Price is $',num2str(input.crzy_bid,'%4.2f')])
addUpdateFcn(rit,bidfcn)
rit
pause(10)

%%
% Note that updateFcns is  1x3 cell array listing the functions that will
% be executed with each update.
rit.updateFcns{:}

%%
% To stop the updates, simply remove the function from the list using the
% |removeUpdateFcn| and pass in function name to remove.  We'll remove the
% last traded price
removeUpdateFcn(rit,rit.updateFcns{3})
rit
pause(10)

%%
% Remove the bid, ask, and news functions
rit.updateFcns{:}
removeUpdateFcn(rit,rit.updateFcns{3})
removeUpdateFcn(rit,rit.updateFcns{2})
removeUpdateFcn(rit,rit.updateFcns{1})
rit
pause(10)

%% Create a Plot that Updates with New Data
% Create a simple plot that has bid, ask, and last trade price for CRZY and
% adds data to the plot as |rit| updates.
h = plot(datenum(rit.lastUpdate),rit.crzy_bid,'-*', ...
     datenum(rit.lastUpdate),rit.crzy_last,'-x', ...
     datenum(rit.lastUpdate),rit.crzy_ask,'-o');
grid on
datetick
legend('Bid','Last','Ask')
ylabel('Price')
xlabel('Time')
title('CRZY Price History')

%%
% Define a function to update the plot
type updatePlotFcn

%%
% Test the function by adding a new update and set x axis updating to auto
updatePlotFcn(h,rit)

%%
% Add it to updateFcns list
addUpdateFcn(rit,@(input) updatePlotFcn(h,input));

%%
% Watch the plot update
pause(30)
gcf;

%%
% remove plot update function before unsubscribing
removeUpdateFcn(rit,rit.updateFcns{1})

%% Unsubscribing
% To unsubscribe from a source of data, use |unsubscribe|.  Note that if
% you have any update functions that are using this data, you need to
% remove them first.
%
% Unsubscribe from the bid price for CRZY.  First get the subscription list
% and IDs
topics = getSubscriptions(rit)
%%
% Now use the topic ID to remove the subscription
unsubscribe(rit,topics.ID(1))
rit

%%
% The data is no longer retrieved and is removed form the rit variable.

%% Cleaning Up
% To properly clean up, you first need to delete the |rotmanTrader|
% connection before clearing it from the workspace.  This stops the updates
% and disconnect from Rotman Interactive Trader.
delete(rit)
clear rit
%%
% We now no longer have a connection.
%
% If you cleared the rit variable before issuing delete, the update timer is
% still running in the background, and you may see errors/warnings.  To
% stop it, issue the following command:
delete(timerfind('Name','RotmanTrader'))
%% Supporting Function
% Define a function to extract news component only
function extractNews(input)
    cellText = strsplit(input,',');
    news = cellText{end-1};
    disp(['Latest news: ', news])
end
